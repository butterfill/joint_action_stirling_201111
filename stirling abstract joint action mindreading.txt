Minimal Theory of Mind & Joint Action

Infants, chimpanzees, scrub-jays and adults under cognitive load can all act in ways whose success is contingent on facts about what others perceive and believe. How are they able to do this?  Some hold that it is by means of representing perceptions and beliefs as such, others counter that it is by representing behaviour only.  Neither view fits the available evidence.  The first part of this talk will describe the construction of a third alternative, minimal theory of mind, capable of explaining how those with limited cognitive resources or little conceptual sophistication may systematically succeed on tasks held to be acid tests for theory of mind including many false belief tasks.

If (as argued) minimal theory of mind cognition exists, how is it linked in evolution or development to full-blown theory of mind cognition?  One conjecture is that the emergence of full-blown theory of mind cognition somehow involves joint action (Knoblich & Sebanz, 2006; Hughes & Leekam, 2004; Moll & Tomasello, 2007).  The second part of this talk will examine this conjecture.  The proposal will be that joint action partially bridges the gap between minimal and full-blown theory of mind cognition because abilities to engage in joint action provide a route to knowledge of othersâ€™ goals distinct from ordinary third-person interpretation.
